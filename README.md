## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Choose Your Workflow

**For Complex Tasks** (multi-file changes, architecture decisions, critical features):
```bash
/planner "implement OAuth authentication system"
/executer
/verifier
/tester
/documenter
/updater
```

**For Simple Tasks** (bug fixes, minor features, single-file changes):
```bash
/orchestrated "add dark mode toggle to header"
```

**Alternative: EPCT Workflow** (Explore, Plan, Code, Test):
```bash
/epct "refactor database connection logic"
# Follows a four-phase approach: Explore → Plan → Code → Test
```

### 2. Decision Matrix

| Criteria | Complete System | Orchestrated |
|----------|----------------|--------------|
| Files affected | Multiple | Single |
| Architecture changes | Yes | No |
| Risk level | High | Low |
| Time estimate | >30 min | <30 min |
| Testing needs | Comprehensive | Basic |
| Documentation | Extensive | Minimal |

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Agent Specialization**
Each agent has a specific role and responsibility, ensuring focused expertise:
- **PLANNER**: Root cause analysis and solution architecture
- **EXECUTER**: Clean code implementation
- **VERIFIER**: Quality and compliance checking
- **TESTER**: Functional validation
- **DOCUMENTER**: Knowledge capture
- **UPDATER**: Version control management

### 2. **Quality Gates**
Built-in checkpoints prevent common issues:
- Type safety verification
- Error handling validation
- Accessibility compliance
- Performance optimization
- Security best practices

### 3. **Knowledge Management**
Systematic capture and application of learnings:
- Pattern documentation in CLAUDE.md
- Reusable solution templates
- Continuous improvement cycle

### 4. **Flexible Scaling**
Process complexity matches task complexity:
- Lightweight workflow for simple tasks
- Comprehensive system for critical implementations
- Parallel execution support for efficiency

### 5. **Alternative Workflows**
The `commands/` directory contains additional workflow patterns:
- **EPCT (Explore, Plan, Code, Test)**: A four-phase iterative approach ideal for:
  - Refactoring existing code
  - Performance optimizations
  - Debugging complex issues
  - Research-driven development

## 🛠️ Example Use Cases

### Complex Task Example: E-commerce Checkout System
```bash
/planner "Design and implement a secure checkout flow with payment processing"
# Creates detailed WORK.md with phases for:
# - Payment gateway integration
# - Security implementation
# - User flow design
# - Error handling
# - Testing strategy

/executer  # Implements based on Phase 1
/verifier  # Ensures PCI compliance, security standards
/tester    # Tests all payment scenarios
/documenter # Captures payment patterns for reuse
/updater   # Commits with detailed change log
```

### Simple Task Example: Add Loading Spinner
```bash
/orchestrated "Add loading spinner to data fetch operations"
# Orchestrated workflow handles:
# - Component creation
# - Integration
# - Basic testing
# - Commit
```
