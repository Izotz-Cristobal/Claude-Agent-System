# First-Run Detection Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented intelligent first-run detection for `/systemcc`, eliminating the need for users to manually run `/analyze`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Analysis Status Tracker (`middleware/analysis-status-tracker.md`)
- Tracks whether a project has been analyzed via status file
- Status file location: `ClaudeFiles/.analysis-status`
- Contains project info, conventions, and timestamp
- Automatically created after first analysis

### 2. Lightweight Analyzer (`middleware/lightweight-analyzer.md`)
- Fast project analysis completing in under 5 seconds
- Parallel execution of all analysis phases
- Detects: tech stack, conventions, commands, patterns
- Optimized for minimal file I/O

### 3. Updated systemcc Command (`commands/systemcc.md`)
- Added first-run detection logic at step 1
- Checks for `.analysis-status` file before proceeding
- If not found: runs lightweight analysis automatically
- Shows user-friendly progress messages
- Seamlessly continues with task after analysis

### 4. Updated Documentation (`CLAUDE.md`)
- Removed all references to `/analyze` command requirement
- Now shows `/systemcc` as the ONLY command needed
- Updated examples to show automatic analysis on first run
- Clarified that analysis happens transparently

## User Experience

### Before:
```bash
User: /analyze
User: /systemcc "add feature"
```

### After:
```bash
User: /systemcc "add feature"
Claude: üîç First time in this project - running analysis first...
        ‚úÖ Analysis complete! Now working on your feature...
```

## Benefits
1. **Zero Learning Curve** - Only one command to remember
2. **Seamless Experience** - Analysis happens automatically
3. **Fast Detection** - Under 5 seconds for analysis
4. **Smart Caching** - Subsequent runs skip analysis
5. **Transparent Process** - Users see what's happening

## Technical Details
- Status file uses YAML format for easy parsing
- Analysis results feed into project memory system
- Re-analysis can be triggered with `--reanalyze` flag
- Status file respects .gitignore patterns
