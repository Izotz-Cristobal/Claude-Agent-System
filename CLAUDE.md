# CLAUDE.md - Claude Agent System
This file provides project-specific guidance to Claude Code when working in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is the Claude Agent System repository - a comprehensive multi-agent workflow system for structured development. 

## How to Use This System

### Quick Start - Unified System
1. **ALWAYS START WITH**: `/systemcc "your task"` - Intelligent routing with Lyra AI optimization
2. **Direct Access** (when you know what you need):
   - `/agetos` - Project initialization and standards
   - `/aidevtasks` - PRD-based feature development
   - `/taskit` - Phase-based execution for large contexts
   - `/orchestrated` - Quick 3-agent workflow
   - `/planner` - Start complete 6-agent system

### Unified System Structure
- **Middleware**: `middleware/` - Universal Lyra AI optimization
- **Workflows**: `workflows/` - All workflow implementations
  - `agent-os/` - Project initialization framework
  - `ai-dev-tasks/` - PRD-based development
  - `complete-system/` - Six-agent validation workflow
  - `orchestrated-only/` - Streamlined three-agent workflow
  - `phase-based-workflow/` - Context-optimized execution
- **Commands**: `commands/` - All command entry points
- **Git Workflows**: `create-worktree.md` and `wt-alias-setup.md`

## Unified System Commands

### NEW: Agent OS Integration
```bash
/agetos init                    # Initialize project with best practices
/agetos analyze                 # Analyze current project state
/agetos standards               # Apply coding standards
```

### NEW: AI Dev Tasks Integration  
```bash
/aidevtasks "build feature"     # Start with PRD creation
/aidevtasks create-prd          # Create Product Requirements
/aidevtasks generate-tasks      # Generate task hierarchy
/aidevtasks process-tasks       # Execute with checkpoints
```

### Master Router with Universal AI Optimization
```bash
/systemcc "describe your task"  # Intelligent routing to any workflow
/systemcc --workflow=agetos "setup standards"  # Force specific workflow
```
**ALL commands now use Lyra AI optimization** - Every prompt is enhanced before execution, ensuring complete specifications and optimal results.

### NEW: Phase-Based Task Execution
```bash
/taskit "complex task description"  # Breaks into phases for optimal execution
```
Decomposes complex tasks into focused phases, reducing context usage by 60-80%.

### Full Workflow (Complex Tasks)
```bash
/planner "describe your problem or idea"  # Strategic analysis
/executer   # Implementation based on Phase 1
/verifier   # Code quality validation
/tester     # Functional testing
/documenter # Documentation updates
/updater    # Version control
```

### Streamlined Workflow (Simple Tasks)
```bash
/orchestrated "implement simple feature"
```

- `commands/agetos.md` - Agent OS commands
- `commands/aidevtasks.md` - PRD workflow commands
- `commands/help.md` - Complete command reference

## File Organization System

### MANDATORY: ClaudeFiles Directory
**ALL non-code files generated by Claude agents MUST be stored in the `ClaudeFiles/` directory structure.** This includes:
- Documentation (learnings, project status, features)
- Test results, bug reports, performance metrics
- Workflow plans, phase outcomes, summaries
- Temporary working files

See `CLAUDE-FILES-ORGANIZATION.md` for complete details.

## Development Guidelines

### Task Complexity Assessment
Before starting any task, assess its complexity:
- **Simple**: Single file changes, bug fixes, minor features → Use orchestrated workflow
- **Complex**: Multi-file changes, architecture decisions, new systems → Use complete workflow

### Quality Standards
- Always follow the agent patterns exactly as documented
- Run appropriate validation for the task complexity
- Document learnings and patterns discovered

### Workflow Integration
The agent system is designed to:
1. Ensure consistent quality across all development
2. Capture knowledge and patterns systematically
3. Prevent common mistakes through structured processes
4. Scale appropriately to task complexity

## Notes
- This system emphasizes quality over speed
- Each agent has specific responsibilities - respect the boundaries
- The global CLAUDE.md at `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` provides general guidelines
- This project-specific file takes precedence for workflow selection

## Agent OS Attribution
The Agent OS framework (.agent-os directory) is integrated from:
