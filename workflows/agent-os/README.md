Agent OS is a comprehensive framework for AI-driven project initialization, standardization, and development workflow establishment.

## Purpose

Agent OS provides:
- Project structure analysis and optimization
- Coding standards establishment
- Development workflow setup
- Tool configuration and integration
- Team convention documentation

## Workflow Components

### 1. Project Analyzer
Analyzes existing project structure and identifies:
- Technology stack
- Current patterns and conventions
- Areas for improvement
- Missing configurations

### 2. Standards Architect
Establishes comprehensive coding standards:
- Language-specific style guides
- Linting and formatting rules
- Git hooks and pre-commit checks
- CI/CD templates
- Documentation standards

### 3. Workflow Builder
Sets up development workflows:
- Branch protection rules
- PR templates
- Issue templates
- Development scripts
- Testing frameworks

## Integration with Claude Agent System

Agent OS serves as the initialization and standardization layer:
- Use before starting new projects
- Apply to existing projects for standardization
- Establish team conventions
- Set up quality gates
