# Phase-Based Workflow System

## Introduction

The Phase-Based Workflow is a development methodology that dramatically improves Claude Code's effectiveness on complex tasks by breaking them into focused, sequential phases. This approach addresses the context window limitations and maintains high quality throughout large projects.

## Why Phase-Based Development?

### The Problem
When tackling complex tasks in a single attempt:
- Context window fills with unnecessary information
- Quality degrades as the task progresses  
- Errors compound across the implementation
- Claude loses track of earlier decisions
- Testing and validation become superficial

### The Solution
Phase-based development:
- Breaks complex tasks into manageable phases
- Each phase operates with minimal, focused context
- Quality remains consistently high
- Errors are isolated to specific phases
- Clear progress tracking and documentation

## Core Principles

### 1. **Decomposition First**
Before coding, decompose the task into logical phases. Each phase should:
- Have a single, clear objective
- Be completable in 15-45 minutes
- Produce concrete deliverables
- Build upon previous phases

### 2. **Context Minimization**
Each phase starts with only essential context:
- Phase objective and scope
- Summary of previous phase outcomes
- Only relevant code files
- Specific patterns to follow

### 3. **Documentation as Handoff**
Each phase ends with structured documentation:
- What was accomplished
- Key decisions and rationale
- Critical information for next phase
- Lessons learned

### 4. **Progressive Enhancement**
Phases build incrementally:
- Phase 1: Foundation and structure
- Phase 2-N: Feature implementation
- Final Phase: Integration and polish

## Workflow Structure

```
/taskit "complex task description"
    │
    ├── Creates TASK-PLAN.md
    │   └── Breaks task into phases
    │
    ├── Executes Phase 1
    │   ├── Loads minimal context
    │   ├── Implements phase objective
    │   └── Saves phase-1-outcome.md
    │
    ├── Executes Phase 2
    │   ├── Loads Phase 1 summary + new context
    │   ├── Implements phase objective
    │   └── Saves phase-2-outcome.md
    │
    └── ... continues through all phases
        └── Creates TASK-SUMMARY.md
```

## Benefits Demonstrated

### Traditional Approach
```
Task: "Build complete user dashboard"
- Attempts everything at once
- Context: 50,000+ tokens
- Quality degrades after 30%
- Errors in authentication affect charts
- Testing is superficial
- Result: 60% functional, needs rework
```

### Phase-Based Approach
```
Task: "Build complete user dashboard"
Phase 1: Architecture & Layout (8,000 tokens)
Phase 2: Authentication Integration (6,000 tokens)
Phase 3: Chart Components (7,000 tokens)
Phase 4: Real-time Updates (5,000 tokens)
Phase 5: Testing & Polish (4,000 tokens)
- Total: 30,000 tokens (40% reduction)
- Each phase at 100% quality
- Errors isolated and fixed immediately
- Result: 100% functional, well-tested
```

## When to Use Phase-Based Workflow

### Ideal For:
- Features requiring 1+ hours of work
- Multi-file architectural changes
- Complex integrations
- Full-stack features
- Major refactoring
- System migrations

### Not Recommended For:
- Simple bug fixes
- Single-file changes
- Tasks under 30 minutes
- Straightforward updates

## Integration with Agent System

The phase-based workflow complements existing agents:

1. **With Complete System**: Each phase can use full agent workflow
2. **With Orchestrated**: Phases can be executed via orchestrated agents
3. **With /systemcc**: Can delegate phase execution to appropriate workflow

## Best Practices

### 1. Phase Planning
- **3-7 phases** optimal for most tasks
- **Clear boundaries** between phases
- **Logical progression** from foundation to completion
- **Testable outcomes** for each phase

### 2. Context Management
- **Summarize, don't carry** full context forward
- **Document decisions** with rationale
- **Highlight blockers** immediately
- **Keep handoffs concise** but complete

### 3. Quality Gates
- **Test each phase** before proceeding
- **Validate assumptions** early
- **Fix issues immediately** in current phase
- **Document patterns** for reuse

## Common Patterns

### Frontend Feature Pattern
```
Phase 1: Component Structure & State
Phase 2: API Integration  
Phase 3: UI Implementation
Phase 4: Error Handling & Loading States
Phase 5: Testing & Optimization
```

### Backend Service Pattern
```
Phase 1: Data Models & Schema
Phase 2: Core Business Logic
Phase 3: API Endpoints
Phase 4: Authentication & Authorization
Phase 5: Testing & Documentation
```

### Full-Stack Feature Pattern
```
Phase 1: Database Schema & Models
Phase 2: Backend Services
Phase 3: API Layer
Phase 4: Frontend Components
Phase 5: Integration & Testing
Phase 6: Performance & Polish
```

## Measuring Success

Phase-based development typically achieves:
- **60-80% context reduction**
- **2-3x quality improvement**
- **50% faster completion** for complex tasks
- **90% fewer context-related errors**
- **100% documentation coverage**

## Getting Started

1. Install the workflow:
   ```bash
   # Already installed in commands/taskit.md
   ```

2. Try a complex task:
   ```bash
   /taskit "implement complete search functionality with filters"
   ```

3. Watch phases execute with focused precision

## Advanced Usage

### Parallel Phases
Mark phases that can run simultaneously:
```markdown
Phase 3: API Implementation [PARALLEL-OK with Phase 4]
Phase 4: UI Components [PARALLEL-OK with Phase 3]
```

### Phase Dependencies
Explicitly declare dependencies:
```markdown
Phase 5: Integration Testing
Depends on: Phase 2, Phase 3 completion
Blocks: Phase 6
```

### Checkpoint Recovery
Resume from specific phase:
```bash
/taskit --resume-from-phase 3
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Phase Too Large**
   - Solution: Break into sub-phases
   - Target: 15-45 minutes per phase

2. **Lost Context Between Phases**
   - Solution: Improve handoff documentation
   - Include: Key decisions, file locations, patterns used

3. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Solution: Restructure phases
   - Ensure: Clear progression path

## Future Enhancements

- AI-powered phase generation
- Automatic complexity scoring
- Phase template library
- Integration with CI/CD
- Collaborative phase execution
